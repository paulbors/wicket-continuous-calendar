Making a release from eclipse
-----------------------------

1. Update POM Versions via eclipse launch configuration eclipse/update_versions.launch 
2. Run Maven build via eclipse launch configuration eclipse/release.launch
3. Change mime-type of apidocs, so they can be directly accessed from svn
	- right click on apidocs/com folder -> Team -> Set Property svn:mime-type to "text/html" (recursively)
	- right click on the single css file -> Team -> Show Properties -> change svn:mime-type to "text/css"
4. Check everything in and make a tag
5. Sign pom.xml, javadoc.jar, sources.jar and binary jar of the following projects
    - wicket-continuous-calendar-parent (only pom.xml and pom.asc)
	- wicket-continuous-calendar
	- wicket-continuous-calendar-wicket15
	- wicket-continuous-calendar-wicket6
	(when signing with with gpg4win, check "detached signature" and "ascii container")
6. For each module you have to rename all pom.xml to module-name-#.#.#.pom and all of the pom.xml.asc to
   module-name-#.#.#.pom.asc then create bundles 'jar -cvf bundle.jar fileA fileB' to be uploaded via
   https://oss.sonatype.org
   - if you upload file by file then for the pom.asc, enter "pom.asc" in the "extension" field
7. Update POM Versions to new SNAPSHOT version via eclipse launch configuration eclipse/update_versions.launch
8. Check everything in
